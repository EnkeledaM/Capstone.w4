Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Italian restaurant** in **Berlin**, Germany,\n    \n    Since there are lots of restaurants in Berlin we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Italian restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met,\n    \n    We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.\"\n   ",
